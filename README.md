# CoverageSplitter

This is PHP based program for splitting crucial and non-crucial CSS from a Chrome browser-generated coverage file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to split the CSS:-

1. Download the latest changes.
2. Place the CoverageSplitter file in the location of your server. Like htdocs of XAMPP.
3. Two things more needed for CoverageSplitter to work, first one is the coverage file generated by the Chrome browser and another one is the name of the CSS file (A particular file you want to split the CSS from the Coverage file) with its type (.css).
4. Insert the name of the CSS file in the CoverageSplitter file by replacing 'Name of the file'. Like 'bootstrap.min.css'.
5. Insert Coverage file location at 'Add location of coverage file'.
6. Then visit the browser and add the link to the CoverageSplitter.php.
7. After the browser completes processing, you will find two files, one for crucial CSS naming crucial.css and another one for non-crucial CSS naming nonCurcial.css.
